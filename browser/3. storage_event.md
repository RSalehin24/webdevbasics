# Storage Event
> read [localStorage](./1.%20local_storage.md) and [sessionStorage](./2.%20session_storage.md) first

In `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` when the data gets updated, then the storage event gets triggered with the following properties:
- key   : with the changed value of key, null if clear()
- oldValue
- newValue
- url   : url of the document where the data is updated
- storageArea   : storage object either `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` where the update took place

**Info**
- Event is the dame for both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`
- `event.storageArea`

**Triggering Functions**
```js
setItem
getItem
clear
```

**When and Where gets triggered**
If two or more tabs or windows of same website (from same origin) are opened in a browser and if you update any storage (local or session) in one window using the following code:
```js
localStorage.setItem('test', 1);
localStorage.getItem('test');
localStorage.clear();
```
then then storage event will be fired on all the other windows, to keep those ones synchronized with the same data.

The event can be listened using the following code:
```js
window.onstorage = event => {
  if (event.key != 'now') return;
  alert(event.key + ':' + event.newValue + " at " + event.url);
};

// or 

window.addEventListener('storage', event => {
  if (event.key != 'now') return;
  alert(event.key + ':' + event.newValue + " at " + event.url);
};

// event.url: url of the document where the data was updated
// this event listened has to be put in all pages as anyone of then can update the value
