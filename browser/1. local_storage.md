# Local Storage

**Properties**  
- client side storage
- key-value pairs
- saves in the browser
- min 5 MB per domain
  - can be configured through settings
- bound to origin
  - origin: (domain/protocol/port)-triplet
  - different protocols or subdomains infer different storage objects
  - they can't access storage objects of one-another
- shared between all tabs and windows from same origin
- data persists through
  - user sessions
  - browser restarts
  - os reboots
- manipulation is done through javascript, not http header
- data shared between all windows, tabs with the same origin
  - origin: (domain/protocol/port)-triplet
  - different protocols or subdomains infer different storage objects
  - url of same origin path can be different
  - data in one window, the change becomes visible in another one
- data set by one origin can't be accessed by other origins
- doesn't expire

**Key-Value**
- Key and Value both must be strings
- In case if they are of other types(number, object etc.), they will automatically be converted to string.

**Difference from cookies**
- not sent to server
- server can't manipulate storage objects through http headers

**Methods**
```js
setItem(key, value)
getItem(key)
removeItem(key)   // clear a key with its value
clear()   // clear all keys with their values
key(Index)    // get the key on a given position
length

Object.keys   // to get all keys
```

**Examples**
```js
localStorage.setItem('test', 1);
```

**Object like access**
> `storage` event don't get trigged when it is accessed as `Object`
```js
// works but not recommended
localStorage.test = 1;   // setItem
console.log(localStorage.test)    // getItem
delete localStorage.test;   // removeItem

// cause of the problem
// keywords like 'length' can be used through setItem, getItem, removeItem etc.
// but can't be set or accessed through object like access
let  key = 'length';
localStorage[key] = 5;    // Error, can't assign length

// storage event triggers when the data is modified
// that event doesn't triggers for object-like access
```

**Looping over keys**
```js
// storage objects are not iterable
for(let i=0, i<localStorage.length, i++){
  let key = localStorage.key
  console.log(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`)
}

// localStorage is iterable over keys but it also outputs few built-in methods like setItem, setItem etc. 
for(key in localStorage){
  if(!localStorgae.hasOwnProperty(key)){
    continue    // Skip properties like getItem, setItem and other built-in properties or methods 
  }

  console.log(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
}

// get the keys "own" keys
let keys = Object.keys(localStorage);
for(let key of keys){
  console.log(`${key}: ${localStorage.getItem(key)}`);
}
```

**KEY VALUE as string**
```js
// store json
// error
localStorage.setItem("user",  {
  name: "John"
});   // will set user to [object object]

// right way
let user_string = JSON.stringify({
  name: "Reyan"
});

localStorage.setItem("user", user_string);
let user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
console.log(user);
```

**Stringify for beautification**
```js
// added formatting options to JSON.stringify to make the object look nicer
JSON.stringify(localStorage, null, 2)
```
