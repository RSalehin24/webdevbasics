# Session Storage
> read [local_storage](./1.%20local_storage.md) first

**Info**
- much less often used than localstorage
- properties and methods are the same as localStorage, but much more limited

**Difference to localStorage**
- exists only within current tab
- doesn't exist on another tab or window
- data survives refresh but doesn't survice closing/opening the tab
- shares data between iframe in the same page assuming they have the same origin
- bound to browser tab along with origin

**Example**
```js
sessionStorage.setItem('test', 1);
// refresh the page once
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem('test'));
// refresh as much as you like
// try other things like opening and closing or loading on a different window
```
